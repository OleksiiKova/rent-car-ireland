### Overview
EireWheels Car Rental is a web application for car rental developed with Django. The project allows users to view available cars at various airports in Ireland, book them, and manage rentals. This website was created as a learning exercise for my fourth portfolio project at Code Institute.

#### First Time User
- As a person who is visiting Ireland for vacation and is looking for a convenient car rental service.
- As a person who is searching for clear information about available cars and rental services.
- As a person who prefers to make bookings online rather than speaking with others.

#### Returning User
- As a returning user, I would like to review all my previous car rental bookings.
- As a returning user who already has an account, I would like to quickly and easily make a reservation for a specific car.
- As a returning user, I would like to see updates to the available vehicles and services on the site so that I can find new and interesting options (for example, new car models).

## UX

### Strategy

### Database structure
After deciding on the project's features, I used Lucidchart to plan the database structure. The diagram below serves as an initial guide, illustrating the types of data and their relationships.

### Design

#### Colours

The following colour palette was used from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/):
