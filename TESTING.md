## Automated Testing

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the application, a comprehensive testing strategy was employed, combining both manual and automated testing methods.

Leveraging Django's built-in testing framework, automated tests were written to cover critical aspects of the application's functionality. This includes views and forms tests to verify that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.

To run the tests, I executed the following command in the terminal:

`python3 manage.py test`

Total Count of Automated Tests: 41

To create the coverage report, I run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

Below are the reports on automated tests.

## Manual Testing

To enhance quality and increase confidence in the correctness of the application, I conducted manual testing in addition to automated tests. This manual testing also targeted areas not covered by the automated tests, ensuring comprehensive validation.

### CSS

During the CSS validation process for this project, a couple of issues were identified that are related to the external CSS resource provided by Leaflet. Specifically:

- Mix-blend-mode Value: The plus-lighter value used in the Leaflet CSS file is not recognized as a valid mix-blend-mode value.
- Behavior Property: The behavior property with the value url(#default#VML) is not supported.
These issues are due to the external Leaflet CSS file hosted at https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css, and not from the custom CSS within this project. As such, they cannot be resolved directly within this project.

If you encounter validation issues or errors related to these external resources, please be aware that they originate from the external library and not from the project's own CSS.

Some of the JavaScript files in this project include Django template variables. When these files are validated using JSHint or similar tools, errors may occur due to the validator not recognizing these Django variables.
For instance, you might encounter errors like:
- 2	Expected '}' to match '{' from line 2 and instead saw '{'.
- 2	Missing semicolon.
- 2	Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
- 2	Missing semicolon.
- 2	Unrecoverable syntax error. (2% scanned).

This error occurs because the validator doesn't interpret the Django template syntax correctly. When the Django variables are removed, the validation errors disappear.
